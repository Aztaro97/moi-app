<!-- DETAIL ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## âœ¨ About MOI City
Introducing the MOI CITY website, designed to revolutionize user-friendly access to government services by incorporating gamification.

Although the current website provides brief service descriptions, user manuals, and demo videos to help users complete their requested services, many users still abandon the process midway. This highlights the need for enhanced user engagement.

MOI CITY fills this gap by integrating a gamification strategy into the process. By providing intuitive, step-by-step instructions that improve user understanding, MOI CITY ensures seamless completion of user requests. The website's UI delivers an engaging and intuitive experience, organized in a clear, step-by-step format. Users will find navigation simple, with all necessary actions easily accessible without extensive searching. Tasks are completed efficiently, akin to a straightforward game, reducing the cognitive load on users.

So join us and discover how we can transform the mundane into something fun!
